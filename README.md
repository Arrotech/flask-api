# Flask API (Starter Template)

You will learn how to use the following `flask API template` to create a `large` and `modularized Back-end System`.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the following [repo](https://github.com/Arrotech/flask-api.git) to your local machine.
2. Create a local virtual environment inside the root directory of the cloned [repo](https://github.com/Arrotech/flask-api.git) i.e `python3 -m venv venv`.
3. Activate the environment as follows: `source .env`.
4. Install all the required dependencies as follows: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. If you want to use your own database, navigate to the root directory and find `.env` file and update the `DATABASE_URI` and `TEST_DATABASE_URI`

**NB** You should also update your `APP SECRET KEY` from the `.env` file.

# How to run the application.

To run the application run the following command `flask run`.

**NB** Make sure your virtual environment is activated.

# Growing Your Application

## 1. Models

### i. Get your database working

### ii. Performing Migrations

### iii. Create New Models

### iv. Adding New Files

## 2. Views

## 3. Services

## 4. Configurations

## 5. Utilities 

## 6. Tests

## 7. Virtual Environment and Environment Variables

**DISCLAIMER (:**
DO NOT push your `.env` files to any version control service such as `GITHUB`. In this tutorial I only did it so you can have an idea of how to use one. This file is for storing secure and private information about you application such as `passwords`, `secret_key`, e.t.c.
A good practice is to add your `.env` file to a `.gitignore` file. This will prevent future push therofore protecting you private data.

## 8. Version Control

## 9. Continuous Integration

## 10. Deployment
