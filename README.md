# Flask API

You will learn how to use the following `flask API template` to create a `large` and `modularized Back-end System`.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the following [repo]() to your local machine.
2. Create a local virtual environment inside the root directory of the cloned [repo]() i.e `python3 -m venv venv`.
3. Activate the environment as follows: `source .env`.
4. Install all the required dependencies as follows: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. If you want to use your own database, navigate to the root directory and find `.env` file and update the `DATABASE_URI` and `TEST_DATABASE_URI`

**NB** You should also update your `APP SECRET KEY` from the `.env` file.

# How to run the application.

To run the application run the following command `flask run`.

**NB** Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
